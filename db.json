      "Description": "I wouldn't say these are easy, but with practice they would be. They are lovely, I made separate dark ones with orange juice and zest, our homemadebyoliver Plum & Brandy Jam and Plum & Amareretto Jam. I also made white chocolate with homemade Gin Rhubarb & Raspberry Jam, I used various toppings, the white chocolate were the favourite, I think because they are sweeter.",
      "Author": "Good Food",
      "Ingredients": [
        "300g good-quality dark chocolate, 70% cocoa solids",
        "300ml pot double cream",
        "50g unsalted butter"
      ],
      "Method": [
        "Chop the chocolate and tip into a large bowl. Put the cream and butter into a saucepan and heat gently until the butter melts and the cream reaches simmering point. Remove from heat, then pour over the chocolate. Stir the chocolate and cream together until you have a smooth mixture. Add any flavourings to the truffle mix at this stage (divide the mixture between bowls and mix in liqueurs or other flavourings, a tsp at a time, to taste. Try bourbon, Grand Marnier, coconut rum or the zest and juice of an orange), or leave plain. Cool and chill for at least 4 hrs.",
        "To shape the truffles, dip a melon baller in hot water and scoop up balls of the mixture, then drop the truffles onto greaseproof paper. Or lightly coat your hands in flavourless oil (such as sunflower) and roll the truffles between your palms. You could also use a piping bag to pipe rounds onto greaseproof paper.",
        "Coat your truffles immediately after shaping. Tip toppings into a bowl and gently roll the truffles until evenly coated, then chill on greaseproof paper. Try: crushed, shelled pistachio nuts; lightly toasted desiccated coconut; or roll a truffle flavoured with orange zest and juice in cocoa powder. To coat in chocolate, line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Melt 100g milk, dark or white chocolate for 10 truffles. Allow chocolate to cool slightly. With a fork, pick up one truffle at a time and hold over the bowl of melted chocolate. Spoon the chocolate over the truffle until well-coated. Place on the baking tray, then chill.",
        "Store in the fridge in an airtight container for 3 days, or freeze for up to a month. Defrost in the fridge overnight. To give as presents, place 8-10 truffles in individual foil or paper cases inside small, lined boxes tied with ribbon. Keep in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to give them."

        "First make the jelly. Grease a 20cm round cake tin and line with cling film (you can use the 23cm tin that you will bake the cake in, but you\u2019ll have to make this the day before so that you can remove it before making the cake). Remove the zest from 4 of the oranges and set aside for the cake. Tip the orange juice and sugar into a saucepan and gently heat to dissolve the sugar. Meanwhile, soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for a few mins until soft. Remove the gelatine from the water, squeeze out any excess and add to the warm orange juice, stir until the gelatine has dissolved. Pour the liquid into the lined cake tin and chill for at least 4 hrs or preferably overnight.",

Bake in the centre of the oven for 55 mins, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then invert onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely.",
        "Now make the ganache. Heat the cream in a small pan until hot. Put the chocolate in a small bowl and pour over the cream, leave for 10 mins, then mix well \u2013 you should be left with a smooth chocolate sauce. Leave at room temperature until the ganache cools and thickens a little (you can put it in the fridge to speed this up, but keep an eye on it, as it will set quickly).",
        "To assemble the cake, place it on a cake stand and trim the top to give you a flat surface. Warm the apricot jam in the microwave until a little runny. Paint it over the top of the cake, then flip the orange jelly out of its tin, and position on top. Using a palette knife, swirl the chocolate ganache over the orange jelly, letting it dribble down the sides of the cake a little. Serve straight away or within 24 hours."

The next day, churn in an ice-cream maker, stirring the stem ginger and syrup into the mixture just before freezing. If you do not have an ice cream machine, you can pour the mixture into a shallow container, cover and freeze until firm but not rock hard, then whizz in a food processor until smooth. Re-freeze and repeat the process 2-3 times more. Store in the freezer until needed."

        "softened butter, for greasing",
        "6 large eggs, separated",
        "140g golden caster sugar",
        "50g cocoa powder",
        "1l tub good-quality vanilla ice cream(not soft scoop)",

      "Method": [
        "Put your freezer on the fast-freeze setting, or clear some space in the coldest part of the freezer. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a 23 x 33cm Swiss roll tin with baking parchment, grease with a little butter and set aside.",
        "First, make the sponge. Put the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and whisk with an electric whisk until thick and creamy. Sift the cocoa powder over the egg mixture and whisk in thoroughly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold a third of the egg whites into the cocoa mixture, then gently fold in the rest until evenly distributed.",
        "Pour into the prepared tin and spread gently with a spatula. Bake in the centre of the oven for 25 mins or until well risen and just beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tin. Remove from the oven, loosen the edges with a round-bladed knife and leave to cool in the tin.",
        "Prepare the filling while the cake is cooling. Place a large sheet of cling film on the work surface, take the ice cream out of its tub and place on top. Working quickly, cover the ice cream with cling film, then press and roll into a long sausage shape. It will need to be 33cm long and around 5cm wide. Wrap a second piece of cling film around the first and twist the ends to maintain the sausage shape. Return to the freezer to harden for at least 1 hr.",
        "Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Take the ice cream out of the freezer, unwrap it and place in the centre of the sponge. Using the parchment to help you, bring up the sides to enclose the ice cream and carefully lift the roll onto the lined baking tray, rotating it so the seal is underneath. Trim the ends. Cover the cake and tin with cling film and place in the freezer for at least 4 hrs, or up to 1 week.",
        "Make the meringue topping 20 mins before serving. Put the sugar and 175ml water in a pan and bring to a rolling boil over a high heat. Continue to boil until it reaches 115C on a sugar thermometer.",
        "Meanwhile, put the egg whites in a large mixing bowl or tabletop mixer and whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Continue whisking at high speed and very slowly trickle in the hot sugar syrup. The meringue will begin to thicken and become glossy after about 10 mins. Continue to whisk until it is just warm, then whisk in the vanilla extract. Use the meringue immediately, as it is easier to work with while warm.",
        "Fit a large piping bag with a 1.5cm star nozzle and fill with the meringue. Take the baking tray out of the freezer and slide the log gently onto a serving platter using a couple of spatulas. Pipe the meringue in lines down the length, then around the ends. Use a cook\u2019s blowtorch to scorch the meringue all over. Alternatively, bake for 8 mins at 220C/200C fan/gas 7 or until the meringue is set and lightly browned. Serve in generous slices (it will sit quite happily for 5-10 mins). Please note this recipe contains lightly cooked egg whites, which may be unsuitable for babies and toddlers, the elderly, pregnant women and people who already feel unwell."

Can be kept for a month well-wrapped in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If short on time, the cake can be made the same day that you decorate it."
